            <p>The Pet Network is a place where different animal charities can advertise what rescues they currently have in their care. The aim of this website is to make it easier for charities to show what dogs/cats they have up for rehoming and also make it easier for users to see what dogs needs homes in their area.</p>

            <p>The idea of The Pet Network started from our love of adopting rescues and wanting to help give charities a platform solely based around them. This gives charities a quick and easy way to show what dogs they have in their care and hopefully give them a wider audience to reach.</p>
            
            <p>This also makes it easier for people looking for a new pet to see dogs or cats from all different charities in one website. This makes it easier for them to find their perfect pet.</p>
